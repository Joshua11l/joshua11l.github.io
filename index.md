### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

     Lab 6, part 1, was my favorite because it involved creating a pattern. It seemed very intimidating initially because it was my first time incorporating loops in code. Creating the pattern was my favorite because it tested my new coding skills. I successfully created the pattern and learned about the importance of using loops. They're great to use for repeating sequences like a pattern. 
    

* Lab 11

     Lab 11, part 2, was my favorite because it involved playing a guessing game using numbers. This game fascinated me because I love playing all sorts of games. The game involved guessing a number with multiple tries. This lab was one of my favorites because I was able to code and create my own unique game. 

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1, was my favorite because it was our last lab, and I was able to create an image from coding. I found this fascinating because you could create a visual image from written code. This lab was the first time I had done this or knew you could create visuals like pictures from code. I learned that you could do all sorts of things with coding and not just collect data.
