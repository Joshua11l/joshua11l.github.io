### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was my favorite because it involved using loops and creating a pattern from it. This was my favorite because it was my firt time using loops to create a pattern of things and I was able to do it succesfully. 
    

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 2 was my favorite because it involved playing a guessing game using numbers. I was able to try and guess a number with multiple tries. This was one of my favroites because I was able to create a unique game from coding. 

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 was my favorite because I was able to create an image just from coding. I have never done this before so being able to create a vizual image from code was very fascinating for me to do.
